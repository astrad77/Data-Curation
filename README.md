## Data Curation

### Contents 
This repository contains the data used in my blog post, as well as the code used to curate the data. The original data was downloaded from the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/" target="_blank">US Energy Information Association</a>. 

`datacuration.py` is the Python script I wrote to clean and combine the data sets. `final_electricity_data.csv` is the result of cleaning and combining the data. The other data files are the data that was downloaded from EIA and/or intermediary data sets created in the process of creating the final data set.
